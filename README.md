# ðŸ§ª TestCafe Automation Practice

This repository contains my personal practice scripts for learning and improving my skills in **TestCafe**, a Node.js tool for automated end-to-end testing of web applications.

## ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s Inside

- Basic examples to get familiar with TestCafe syntax
- Practice tests for logging in, form submission, navigation, etc.
- Use of selectors, assertions, and page actions
- Organized by test case for easy understanding

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Tests

### 1. Install TestCafe

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then install TestCafe:

```bash
npm install -g testcafe
````

Or if using locally in your project:

```bash
npm install --save-dev testcafe
```

### 2. Run a Test

Use this command to run any test file (replace with your preferred browser):

```bash
testcafe chrome tests/example.test.js
```

Or run all tests:

```bash
testcafe chrome tests/
```

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

```
/tests         â†’ Main test files
/pages         â†’ Optional page objects (for cleaner code)
README.md      â†’ This file
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

The purpose of this repo is to practice:

* Writing clean and simple test cases
* Understanding how TestCafe works
* Preparing for real-world testing projects or interviews

This is **not a production-ready project**, just a learning space.

Feel free to explore, clone, or adapt these scripts for your own learning. Happy testing!
